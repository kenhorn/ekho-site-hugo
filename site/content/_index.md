      Many markets are not liquid enough to sustain a lit order book -- whether
      due to the complexities of multiple physical locations or simply a poorly
      connected participant network. For these markets, our RFQ platform is an
      excellent fit.

      For higher liquidity products, our Match platform provides a modern,
      capable limit order book and easy-to-use trading GUI.
values:
  heading: Transparency
  text: >-
    Too often a lack of transparency and clarity of motivations in a market can
    erode confidence and hence impact transaction volumes. We are committed to a
    level playing field in all participants.
